			The University of Arizona has thousands of devices to keep track of in its various datacenters.
			I inherited an old MS Access database someone had started in the late 90's to help manage 
			this equipment, and transformed it into a modern web application.
		</p>

		<p>
			The application framework I used here was CakePHP, a modern PHP based MVC framework.  For the
			front end UI, I used the Dojo javascript framework.  The result is a responsive,
			single window, AJAX driven web application.
