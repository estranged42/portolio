		During the 2020 COVID pandemic, my brother and I started playing Magic: The Gathering together again
		virtually over Zoom. After a couple of games I lamented the fact that we couldn't easily see each
		others cards, or read the descriptions. I looked around a bit for virtual shared game table, but 
		everything I found wanted you to play the entire game within their app. We had all our physical cards,
		wanted to play with those, and just needed something to share the state of the game table with each other.
		
		<p>
		Since I had been out of the web app building business for a few years at this point, I took this as 
		an opportunity to get familiar with the more modern web application technologies, and this app was
		the result.
