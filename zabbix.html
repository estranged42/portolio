		<p>
			Zabbix is an open source Enterprise Monitoring solution.  It gathers information about servers
			and network devices, and alerts operations staff to problems that arise.
		</p>

		<p>
			Implementing and running Zabbix for UITS was a big challenge.  UITS monitors over 3000 different
			servers, network equipment, electrical, environmental, and vendor appliances.  Just getting
			the basics of those devices imported and discovered took the better part of six months.  Once
			the basics were in place, the fun began.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  Gathering the data really turns out to be the easy part.  The difficult part in data analysis 
		  is usually in asking the correct question.  Developing use cases, and asking the right
		  questions was critical to the on-going success of this project.  With the right questions in
		  hand, gathering, displaying, and alerting on the data flowed easily.
		</p>

    <p>
      Because of its open source nature, Zabbix is very expandable.  There was never a case where 
      the data we sought could not be imported into Zabbix.  Often this required writing customized
      code to interface with a particular bit of software or application.  I wrote these custom collector
      programs in a variety of languages: Perl, C, Python, C#, PowerShell, PHP, and
      shell script.
    </p>		

    <p>
      Zabbix is a treasure trove of data, and getting that data out in the right fashion was also
      a project in itself.  Data can be displayed directly within the Zabbix web interface, but it
      also contains a powerful REST API that allows data to be pulled out for use in customized 
      dashboards, as well as other applications.
