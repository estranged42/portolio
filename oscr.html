			OSCR's mission statement was "Putting technology in the hands of UA students."  They did
			this in a variety of ways.  They ran several computing labs around campus, from general
			access labs, to multimedia labs with specialized hardware and software.  They also ran the
			Gear to Go program, which let students check out multimedia equipment including digital 
			video cameras, still cameras, and audio equipment. OSCR also employed nearly a hundred 
			student employees to run the various labs and services.

			I was responsible for the overall look and feel of the OSCR website.  I created all the
			graphical elements with the exception of the OSCR wordmark, hand logo, and 
			some of the great photography.

			Homepage banner images rotated on each page refresh.  The images highlighted various

			Organizing the many aspects of OSCR's services and presenting them to our audience on a
			website was a big challenge.  Equipment and software changed rapidly, as did student 
			employees and their schedules.  We created a custom web application and content management
			environment years before software like Drupal was mature.  We had to do this in order to
			allow many different people throughout OSCR to keep their information up to date.  We
			brought all that information together in many places on the websites, such as the following
			location page.

			Scheduled open and closed hours, along with reservations for classes and workshops are
			pulled in from the administration site.

			Software is tied to locations and employees.  This allows you to find what software is 
			in what location, and also which employees are capable of helping you.  Scheduling
			information is also pulled in from a 3rd party scheduling service, allowing you to 
			easily find who, when, and where to get help with your project.
		</div>

		<div class="graphpaper comment rotate1" style="left: 460px; top: 1220px;">
			Peripherals are a certain type of resource defined in the administration site.  Resources
			are tied to locations so that it is easy to find what locations support what type of
			peripherals.
		</div>

		<div class="graphpaper comment rotate2" style="left: -120px; top: 1620px;">
			Student staff are brought in to location pages based on data from our 3rd party scheduling
			service.  They provide us with an XML data feed which we refresh nightly, so we always
			have an up to date list of who's working where, and when.
