			Working at the University of Arizona for the bulk of my professional experience has been great. I 
			really like working at a place that isn't just out to make money, but also has a loftier goal of 
			trying to improve the lives of the students who attend here. I've always enjoed teaching. So when
			the opportunity came to teach a course in web programming for the University's Computer Science 
			department, I jumped on it. I taught CS 337 to 80 students in the fall of 2014, and to 100 students
			in the spring of 2016.
		</p>

		<p>
			I've taught workshops and other technical training a lot over the years. I taught multi-day 
			workshops in Photoshop and Illustrator back in the 2000s. I've given talks at conferences, and 
			developed a lot of in-house training materials for co-workers and customers. But I had never 
			taught a semester long university level course before, and it was a little scary! 
		</p>

		<p>
			Fortunately, I had been a professional web developer for over 15 years at this point, and felt I 
			definitely had a lot to bring to students who were just getting started.

			If you want to just jump into what the course website and the course slides,
			<a href="cs337/index.html">you can see a timecapsule of the site</a> or look at
			<a href="https://github.com/estranged42/csc337-website">the repository on Github.</a>

            I developed new slides for the whole curriculum as there wasn't much provided by the department.

			I was given a basic set of course objectives by the department, but largely left on my own to develop the course
			curriculum, assignments, and assessments. I focused on a strong foundation of the HTTP protocol, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
			The department required the backend programming language be PHP at the time. 


		<p>
			I thourghouly enjoyed teaching this class the two semesters I did. I have nothing but respect for full-time teachers
			who make this their living! It is a ton of work, but definitely worth it. Having the opportunity to introduce nearly two
			hundred students to the world of web development that I love was increadibly rewarding.
