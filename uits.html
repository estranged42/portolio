			The University Information Technology Services department comprised about three hundred
			career and student staff.  We were responsible for the core technology infrastructure
			at the University of Arizona.
		</p>

		<p>
			As the Web Services Team Lead, I was responsible for most of the customer facing websites
			within UITS.  The main UITS website was our largest, and most visible website.  During 
			2008 and 2009 we undertook a complete redesign of the site.  We began with an analysis of
			our customers, both internal and external.  We implemented a service catalog, in keeping with
			the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Technology_Infrastructure_Library" target="_new">ITIL practices</a>
			adopted by our department.  We also migrated several of the tools we had built for the
			Office of Student Computing Resources, most notability the workshop registration system.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The new UITS website was built upon the Drupal content management system.  This was our
			first large site built on Drupal.  Our previous sites were built upon our own custom 
			application framework.  While the framework we built was great for the more data-heavy
			parts of a website, it was not designed for rapid update of major static content.  This
			is something Drupal excels in out of the box.  I was able to write some custom modules for
			Drupal that allowed our application framework to work within the Drupal content management
			system.  This ultimately lead to an easy to update site, with powerful web application 
			elements.

			Current alerts are pulled from a custom RSS feed system.  Entries are posted in the
			administration site, which can send the alerts to multiple listservs and websites
			simultaneously.

		<div class="graphpaper comment rotate1" style="left: -150px; top: 160px">
			The overall theme of the site was designed to complement the new main University of Arizona
			website:  <a href="http://www.arizona.edu" target="_new">http://www.arizona.edu</a>
			<p>
			Two of the graphic designers on our team came up with the primary design and layout. 
			I was responsible for the final HTML/CSS markup for the site.

			Various stats are pulled in real-time from our departmental monitoring system, Zabbix.  Graphs
			are drawn via PHP, and composited with numbers and text.

			The workshop portion of the site is a web application that allows for users to view,
			register for, and see the history of workshops that they have taken.  The first time
			we see a user, they are required to register with our system.  This allows us to track
			their workshop history, and report out who has taken what workshops.  
			<p>
			We worked closely with the Workshop and Training team in UITS to make sure that their requirements
			are met on a timely basis.  Workshops are required for access to many of the main
			enterprise systems on campus, such as payroll, time reporting, class scheduling, and much more.
			The accurate, reliable, and approachable workshop tools are essential for the smooth
			processing of access requests to the many enterprise systems.
			</p>

		<div class="graphpaper comment rotate1" style="left: 520px; top: 220px">
			Workshops are scheduled and managed from the UITS / OSCR Administration site.  The tools
			allow new types of workshops to be created, and allows workshops to be scheduled including
			instructor and location information as well as dates and times.
