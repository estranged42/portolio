			Prior to 2015, the majority of University of Arizona IT infrastructure was highly virtualized in a pair of
            datacenters managed by UITS - University Information Technology Services. The main datacenter was on campus
            in the <a href="https://map.arizona.edu/73">Computer Center (building 77)</a>. The backup datacenter was a few miles 
            away in downtown Tucson. We mostly used the VMWare VSphere virtualization platform at the time.

        <p>
            Our CTO at the time presented a few of us in UITS with the opportunity to help lead the migration of much of our
            enterprise applications from on-prem virtualized servers to Amazon's public cloud AWS, and I was fortunate to be chosen to
            join that project.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the time, very few people in UITS knew much about AWS at all, so we were mostly starting from scratch.  We did have 
            AWS come in and do some high level training, but it was very much a marketing style training. We mostly learned that AWS 
            has a ton of services, and that they might be useful for us!  
        </p>

        <p>
            Shortly after the project started, I was moved into the newly created Enterprise Cloud Services team. To start the team
            was really just my boss Josh Shaloo, and myself. One of the biggest changes I brought to the initiative was a standardized
            way for deploying new AWS accounts. 2015-2018 pre-dated many of AWS's current methods for making this less painful, such 
            as Organizations and Control Tower. I developed a set of CloudFormation templates that established baseline user roles, 
            federated login through SAML SSO, VPC network configurations, and basic security controls for all newly created AWS accounts.
            Parts of these templates are still in use by the current Cloud Team as I write this in 2024.

            Over the course of the next few years, we successfully migrated our Student system, HR system, Financials system, Identity
            and Access Management systems, into AWS along with dozens of other smaller services. Today in 2024 the University of Arizona
            deploys nearly all new services to AWS, and the flexible architecture I helped the team put together has allowed us to stay 
            compentitive. We're able to do things more quickly than ever before, and allow service teams the fexibility of running experiments
            and troubleshoot problems with rapidly deployed temporary environments.
