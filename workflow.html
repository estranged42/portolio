			When we first decided to try and solve our in-processing problem, we looked around for an 
			existing solution to the workflow problem.  Unfortunately at the time (and largely still today)
			the only solutions that tackled generic workflow management were hugely expensive applications
			from the likes of Oracle and IBM.  Eventually we decided to go ahead and build a flexible 
			workflow management application ourselves, with the hope of turning it into an open source 
			project.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The result is a fully object oriented application written in PHP.  The basic concepts are that
			of a workflow, an element, and an execution.  A workflow defines the template that each 
			execution will follow.  The execution is one run of the workflow, with a reference object
			attached to it.  In the case of our in-processing workflow, the reference object is the person
			being hired.

			The overview of a workflow execution displays an at-a-glance view of what steps are
			finished, and where the workflow is currently at.
		</div>

		<div class="graphpaper comment rotate1" style="left: -50px; top: 650px;">
			Each element is a separate object that can contain specific code for notifying people,
			checking existing values, or doing other work.

		<div class="graphpaper comment rotate2" style="left: 450px; top: 100px;">
			Each element can track whatever data is needed for that element.  When an element is marked
			completed, the outbound elements attached to this one are activated.  Each element has an
			activation and completion hook which allows custom code to be run.  
			<p>In this case when the
			element is completed, a new user is inserted into our users table, and the appropriate roles
			for this position are assigned.</p>
		</div>
		
		
		<div class="graphpaper comment rotate1" style="left: 220px; top: 500px; width: 350px;">
			Each workflow and element can be versioned, so that improvements can be made without breaking 
			existing executions.
